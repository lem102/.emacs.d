* TODO fix typescript indenting freezes
Possibly wait until emacs 29 tree sitter is available, switch to that
and use that instead.
It turns out that there will be a typescript mode in emacs core from
29, so I should remove all ts packages when upgrading to emacs 29.
* TODO instant messaging
** TODO slack
** TODO discord
** TODO whatsapp
* TODO investigate lsp-bridge
Eglot is being moved into emacs core. while this is great, I have
noticed that emacs is definitely slowed by all the processing required
to do lsp stuff. lsp-bridge is a possible solution to that, however it
introduces a dependency on python and some python packages. this is
undesireable as it reduces emacs' cross platform nature, but could be
worth it.

tl;dr: investigation required
