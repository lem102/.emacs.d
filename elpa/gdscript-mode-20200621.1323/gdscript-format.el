;;; Commentary:

;; Format a buffer containing GDScript code with the gdformat GDScript formatter.
;; This code is derived from gdtoolkit, see https://github.com/Scony/godot-gdscript-toolkit

;;; Code:

(defun gdscript-format--format-region (start end)
  "Format the region between START and END using `gdformat'."
  (let
      ((cmd (concat "echo " (shell-quote-argument (buffer-substring start end)) "|" gdscript-gdformat-executable " -"))
       (error-buffer "*gdformat-errors*"))
    (if (eq (with-temp-buffer (call-process-shell-command cmd)) 0)
        (save-excursion
          (shell-command-on-region start end cmd (buffer-name) t error-buffer t))
      (progn
        (with-current-buffer error-buffer (erase-buffer))
        (shell-command-on-region start end cmd nil nil error-buffer t)))))

(defun gdscript-format-region()
  "Format the selected region using `gdformat'"
  (interactive)
  (gdscript-format--format-region
